# DisCatcher

## A new bot to play pokecord!

### Why this bot?

> - Never Deprecated: Discord has been slowly eating away at self bots. This new bot doesn't need a token and doesn't rely on selfbot APIs not going extinct.
> - Regular user behaviour
> - Same fast catching ability
> - More to come!

### How do I get this bot?

> **Note:** The bot is in a beta stage and does not have an official release. However, donating will get you access to all version
up to the release of 1.0.
 
> Please also note that buying a release doesn't give you access to all future releases and features. There will be a cost associated with
that in the future.
> Custom addons may be added for an additional cost

Right now for test access -> 1.0 release it's currently set to $5. This may change depending on the future features added.
#### Test features at the moment include:
- Catching (Currently only printed to the console)
- Spamming (Modifiable times)
#### Beta features
- autoleveling/switching
